Single-responsibility principle (SRP) states: `There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.` In other words, every class should have
only one responsibility.

Imagine the following application:

```php
class Square
{
    public $length;

    public function construct($length)
    {
        $this->length = $length;
    }
}
```

```php
class Circle
{
    public $radius;

    public function construct($radius)
    {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }
}
```

```php
class AreaCalculator
{
    protected $shapes;

    public function __construct($shapes = [])
    {
        $this->shapes = $shapes;
    }

    public function sum()
    {
        foreach ($this->shapes as $shape) {
            if (is_a($shape, 'Square')) {
                $area[] = pow($shape->length, 2);
            } elseif (is_a($shape, 'Circle')) {
                $area[] = pi() * pow($shape->radius, 2);
            }
        }

        return array_sum($area);
    }

    public function output()
    {
        return implode('', [
          '',
              'Sum of the areas of provided shapes: ',
              $this->sum(),
          '',
      ]);
    }
}
```

```php
$shapes = [
  new Circle(2),
  new Square(5),
  new Square(6),
];

$areas = new AreaCalculator($shapes);

echo $areas->output();
```

**What violates the SRP principle:** `AreaCalculator` handles the logic to output the data. The `AreaCalculator` class should only
be concerned with the sum of the areas of provided shapes. It should not care how to output data: whether the user wants
JSON or HTML.

**How to fix it:** you can create a separate `SumCalculatorOutputter` class and use it to handle the logic you need to output
the data to the user:

```php
class SumCalculatorOutputter
{
    protected $calculator;

    public function __constructor(AreaCalculator $calculator)
    {
        $this->calculator = $calculator;
    }

    public function JSON()
    {
        $data = [
          'sum' => $this->calculator->sum(),
      ];

        return json_encode($data);
    }

    public function HTML()
    {
        return implode('', [
          '',
              'Sum of the areas of provided shapes: ',
              $this->calculator->sum(),
          '',
      ]);
    }
}
```

Usage would look like this:
```php
$shapes = [
  new Circle(2),
  new Square(5),
  new Square(6),
];

$areas = new AreaCalculator($shapes);
$output = new SumCalculatorOutputter($areas);

echo $output->JSON();
echo $output->HTML();
```
