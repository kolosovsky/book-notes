### Part 1. Fundamental Facts You Should Know About Worry
- RULE 1: If you want to avoid worry, do what Sir William Osier did: Live in "day-tight
compartments". Don't stew about the future. Just live each day until bedtime.
- RULE 2: The next time Trouble-with a capital T- comes gunning for you and backs you
up in a corner, try the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier:
  1. Ask yourself, "What is the worst that can possibly happen if I can't solve my
problem?"
  2. Prepare yourself mentally to accept the worst-if necessary.
  3. Then calmly try to improve upon the worst-which you have already mentally agreed
to accept.
- RULE 3: Remind yourself of the exorbitant price you can pay for worry in terms of your
health. "Business men who do not know how to fight worry die young."

half the worry in the world is caused by people trying to make decisions before they
have sufficient knowledge on which to base a decision."
- RULE 2: After carefully weighing all the facts, come to a decision.
- RULE 3: Once a decision is carefully reached, act! Get busy carrying out your decisionand
dismiss all anxiety about the outcome.
- RULE 4: When you, or any of your associates are tempted to worry about a problem,
write out and answer the following questions:
  1. What is the problem?
  2. What is the cause of the problem?
  3. What are all possible solutions?
  4. What is the best solution?
