## Can, could and (be) able to

##### we use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something
> We can see the lake from our hotel.

##### sometimes could is the past of can
> We had a lovely room in the hotel. We could see the lake.

##### you can say that somebody is able to do something
> We are able to see the lake from our hotel.

##### can has only two forms: can (present) and could (past). so sometimes it is necessary to use (be) able to
> I haven't been able to sleep recently.

> Tom might be able to come tomorrow.

##### we use could for general ability. but if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use was/were able to or managed to. compare:
> Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He could beat anybody.

> Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack managed to beat him.

## Could (do) and could have (done)

##### sometimes could is the past of can, but we also use could to talk about possible actions now or in the future
> What shall we do tonight?
>
> We could go to the cinema.

##### we also use could (not can) for actions that are not realistic. compare:
> I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)

> Maybe I could stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)

> This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever. (unrealistic)

##### we use could have (done) to talk about the past. compare:
> The situation is bad, but it could be worse. (now)

> The situation was bad, but it could have been worse. (past)

## Must and can't

##### you can use must to say that you believe something is certain
> You've been travelling all day. You m ust be tired.

##### you can use can't to say that you believe something is not possible
> You've just had lunch. You can't be hungry already.

##### for the past we use must have (done) and can't have (done)
> I've lost one of my gloves.
>
> You must have dropped it somewhere.

> Tom walked into a wall. He can't have been looking where he was going.

##### you can use couldn't have instead of can't have
> Tom couldn't have been looking where he was going.

## May and might

##### we use may or might to say that something is possible. usually you can use may or might
> She might know, or She may know.

##### for the past we use may have (done) or might have (done)

>
> She may have been asleep. (= perhaps she was asleep)

##### to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future

##### we use only might (not may) when the situation is not real
> If they paid me better, I might work harder. (not I may work)

## Have to and must

##### I have to do something = it is necessary to do it
> I have to wear glasses for reading.

>

##### mustn't and don't have to are completely different
> You must keep this a secret. You mustn't tell anyone. (= it is necessary that you do not do it)

> You don’t have to tell Tom what happened. I can tell him myself. (= you don't need to do it (but you can if you want))

##### you can use have got to instead of have to.
> I've got to work tomorrow. or I have to work tomorrow.

## Must, mustn't, needn't

##### needn't do or don't need to do something = it's not necessary to do it
> We've got plenty of time. We needn't hurry.

> We don’t need to hurry.

##### needn't have done something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary
> Why did he get up at 5 o'clock? He needn't have got up so early.

##### didn't need to do something = it was not necessary to do it. it doesn't matter whether he did it or not
