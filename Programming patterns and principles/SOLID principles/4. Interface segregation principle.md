Interface segregation principle (ISP)
states: `A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.`

Let's consider the following example:

```php
interface ShapeInterface
{
    public function area();

    public function volume();
}
```

**What violates the LSP principle:** any shape you create must implement the `volume` method, but you know that squares
are flat shapes and that they do not have volumes, so this interface would force the `Square` class to implement a
method that it has no use of.

**How to fix it:** create another interface called `ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface` that has the `volume` contract and
three-dimensional shapes can implement this interface.

```php
interface ShapeInterface
{
    public function area();
}

interface ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface
{
    public function volume();
}

class Square implements ShapeInterface
{
    public function area() { /* calculate the area of the square */ }
}

class Cuboid implements ShapeInterface, ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface
{
    public function area() { /* calculate the surface area of the cuboid */ }

    public function volume() { /* calculate the volume of the cuboid */ }
}
```
