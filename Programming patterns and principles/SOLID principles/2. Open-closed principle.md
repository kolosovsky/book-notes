Open-closed principle (OCP) states: 
> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.

Let’s revisit the `AreaCalculator` class and focus on the sum method:

```php
class AreaCalculator
{
    protected $shapes;

    public function __construct($shapes = [])
    {
        $this->shapes = $shapes;
    }

    public function sum()
    {
        foreach ($this->shapes as $shape) {
            if (is_a($shape, 'Square')) {
                $area[] = pow($shape->length, 2);
            } elseif (is_a($shape, 'Circle')) {
                $area[] = pi() * pow($shape->radius, 2);
            }
        }

        return array_sum($area);
    }
}
```

**What violates the OCP principle:** Consider a scenario where the user would like the sum of additional shapes like
triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc. You would have to constantly edit this file and add more if/else blocks.

**How to fix it:** move the logic to calculate the area of each shape out of the `AreaCalculator` class to each shape’s
class. Also, we should create and use `ShapeInterface`.

```php
interface ShapeInterface
{
    public function area();
}
```

```php
class Square implements ShapeInterface
{
    public $length;

    public function __construct($length)
    {
        $this->length = $length;
    }

    public function area()
    {
        return pow($this->length, 2);
    }
}
```

```php
class Circle implements ShapeInterface
{
    public $radius;

    public function construct($radius)
    {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }

    public function area()
    {
        return pi() * pow($shape->radius, 2);
    }
}
```

```php
class AreaCalculator
{
    // ...

    public function sum()
    {
        foreach ($this->shapes as $shape) {
            if (is_a($shape, 'ShapeInterface')) {
                $area[] = $shape->area();
                continue;
            }

            throw new AreaCalculatorInvalidShapeException();
        }

        return array_sum($area);
    }
}
```
