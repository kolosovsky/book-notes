Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
states:
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the
> low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

This principle allows for decoupling.

Here is an example of a PasswordReminder that connects to a MySQL database:

```php
class MySQLConnection
{
    public function connect()
    {
        // handle the database connection
        return 'Database connection';
    }
}

class PasswordReminder
{
    private $dbConnection;

    public function __construct(MySQLConnection $dbConnection)
    {
        $this->dbConnection = $dbConnection;
    }
}
```

**What violates the DIP principle:** the `PasswordReminder` class is being forced to depend on the `MySQLConnection`
class.

**How to fix it:** make the `PasswordReminder` depend on an abstraction (interface), not a concretion (class).

```php
interface DBConnectionInterface
{
    public function connect();
}

class MySQLConnection implements DBConnectionInterface
{
    public function connect()
    {
        // handle the database connection
        return 'Database connection';
    }
}

class PasswordReminder
{
    private $dbConnection;

    public function __construct(DBConnectionInterface $dbConnection)
    {
        $this->dbConnection = $dbConnection;
    }
}
```
